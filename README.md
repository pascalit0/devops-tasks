## Part 1 - Writing

### Proudest achievements
1. Terraform: Direct AWS API Gateway connection to a S3 bucket in order to place a xls file:
All other actions had been done already using lamdbas in between, so I had to refactor the existing terraform code.
2. Refactoring of all UnitTests for having a uniform naming convention, structure and test scenarios
3. Implement an abstraction layer for the keycloak api that serves our project needs
4. Reverse engineering in a Liferay project to use existing internal services for content parsing/import


### Personal meaning of DevOps
A role that takes cares that...
* ...every part of the infrastructure is *"documented"* via code (IaC) so that there are no manual and undocumented steps left
  * with this everything can easily be reconstructed, moved or duplicated
* ...every build and deployment of software is automated through CI / CD Pipelines
  * the pipelines itself are also part of the IaC within a repository


### Prefer Emacs or Vim?
Nano ;-)
